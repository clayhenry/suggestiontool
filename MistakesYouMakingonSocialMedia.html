    <h1>3 Marketing Mistakes You are Making on Social Media</h1>

<p>
    Social media is the place to market these days and everyone knows it. But that doesn't mean that everyone knows how to do it. Social media marketing is very different to the more traditional marketing platforms of the past and it has different rules. For those people who think it's an easy transition between one and the next, they need to think again. This is a completely unique marketing platform, one that's becoming bigger and bigger and it means you need to tailor your approach to it and to the people who use it. So here are three marketing mistakes you might be making on social media.
<p>
    1.	Not having a plan. Though social media seems to suggest it requires a casual approach, for someone looking to use it for business and marketing, this doesn't mean being ad hoc and complacent about it. You still need to create a plan before you start your campaign or your business profiles. If you've already started, it's not too late to go back to the drawing board and look at what you're hoping to accomplish so that you can create a plan to get you there. There are many online resources that will help you if you don't know what this plan should look like.
</p>
<p>
    2.	Talking at your market instead of to them. This is the biggest mistake that businesses make while marketing on social media. You need to use social media as it's meant to be used- socially. It's a time-consuming way to market but it's worth it. Being too professional in the social media world can be a big turn-off for potential consumers. They're there to relax and connect, so offer them the chance to do both. Don't be a faceless corporation with no personality who is trying to sell, sell, sell. This is who the next generation of consumers are learning to ignore. Shouting about your product and services reeks of desperation and will have people actively avoiding you and your brand. Word of mouth can work against you just as well as it can work for you. People love to complain so don't give them something to complain about. You don't want to inundate your target market to the point of turning them off of your brand. Self-promotion is annoying and no one likes to see it. Don't create spammy advertisements. People want subtle marketing, suggestions rather than demands and in-your-face sales tactics.
</p>
<p>
    3.	Spreading yourself too thin. Social media is a black hole for marketing and engagement. If you spread yourself too thin, you'll never see results. Your target market doesn't use every single social media platform and you don't need to either. Choose the ones most important to your target audience and make those profiles really work for you. Social media isn't about constant posting either. Choose the right times and post quality content. Quantity won't get you there are quickly as quality. Social media is about making the most of organic growth and word of mouth so help it along by focusing your content and targeting your posts.
</p>

<p>Social media marketing is very different from conventional marketing. No one wants to be spammed, everyone hates advertisements and you need to step away from the professional mask and interact with your target market. You still need a plan in place to help keep you on </p>
<p>track and to be able to gauge your performance. Part of that plan should include knowing who your market is and where they hang out. Then that's where you need to be. You don't have to have an account on every social media platform going, just the few important ones where you can target your content for maximum advantage. And don't forget to be social. This is, after all, the point of social media platforms and even if you forget it, your audience won't.</p>
